# **Pihole with Unbound & DNS over TCP (DoT)**

Automated: Proxmox Helper Script

Bypass IntenetSehat via DNS-Over-HTTPS is a protocol for performing DNS lookups via the same protocol you use to browse the web securely: HTTPS. 

OS: Debian 12

## Installing cloudflared

1. Update the VM
```bash
apt-get update && apt-get upgrade -y
```

2. Add Cloudflared's installer package
```bash
# For Debian/Ubuntu
wget https://github.com/cloudflare/cloudflared/releases/latest/download/cloudflared-linux-amd64.deb
sudo apt-get install ./cloudflared-linux-amd64.deb
cloudflared -v
```

## Configuring cloudflared to run on startup


3. Create a `cloudflared` user to run the daemon:
```bash
sudo useradd -s /usr/sbin/nologin -r -M cloudflared
```
	
4. Proceed to create a configuration file for `cloudflared`
```bash
sudo nano /etc/default/cloudflared
```

5. Edit configuration file by copying the following in to `/etc/default/cloudflared`. This file contains the command-line options that get passed to cloudflared on startup:
```bash
# Commandline args for cloudflared, using Cloudflare DNS
CLOUDFLARED_OPTS=--port 5053 --upstream https://cloudflare-dns.com/dns-query
```

6. Update the permissions for the configuration file and `cloudflared` binary to allow access for the cloudflared user:
```bash
sudo chown cloudflared:cloudflared /etc/default/cloudflared
sudo chown cloudflared:cloudflared /usr/local/bin/cloudflared
```


7. Then create the systemd script by copying the following into /etc/systemd/system/cloudflared.service. This will control the running of the service and allow it to run on startup:
```
sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/cloudflared.service
```

```bash
[Unit]
Description=cloudflared DNS over HTTPS proxy
After=syslog.target network-online.target

[Service]
Type=simple
User=cloudflared
EnvironmentFile=/etc/default/cloudflared
ExecStart=/usr/local/bin/cloudflared proxy-dns $CLOUDFLARED_OPTS
Restart=on-failure
RestartSec=10
KillMode=process

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

8. Enable the systemd service to run on startup, then start the service and check its status:

```
sudo systemctl enable cloudflared
sudo systemctl start cloudflared
sudo systemctl status cloudflared
```

9. Now test that it is working! Run the following dig command, a response should be returned similar to the one below:

```bash
pi@raspberrypi:~ $ dig @127.0.0.1 -p 5053 google.com

; <<>> DiG 9.11.5-P4-5.1-Raspbian <<>> @127.0.0.1 -p 5053 google.com

## Configuring Pi-hole

10. Finally, configure Pi-hole to use the local `cloudflared` service as the upstream DNS server by specifying `127.0.0.1#5053` as the Custom DNS (IPv4):

## Updating cloudflared

The cloudflared tool will not receive updates through the package manager. However, you should keep the program update to date. You can either do this manually (e.g. by watching their repo for new releases), or via a cron script.

The procedure for updating depends on how you configured the cloudflared binary.

	If you configured cloudflared with your own service files
	If you configured cloudflared manually (by writing a systemd unit yourself), to update the binary you'll simply redownload the binary from the same link, and repeat the install procedure.
```bash
wget https://github.com/cloudflare/cloudflared/releases/latest/download/cloudflared-linux-arm
sudo systemctl stop cloudflared
sudo mv -f ./cloudflared-linux-arm /usr/local/bin/cloudflared
sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/cloudflared
sudo systemctl start cloudflared
cloudflared -v
sudo systemctl status cloudflared
```


If you configured cloudflared via service install
If you configured cloudflared using their service install command, then you can use the built in update command.

```bash
sudo cloudflared update
sudo systemctl restart cloudflared
```


## Automating Cloudflared Updates

If you want to have the system update cloudflared automatically, simply place the update commands for your configuration method in the file /etc/cron.weekly/cloudflared-updater, and adjust permissions:

```
sudo chmod +x /etc/cron.weekly/cloudflared-updater
sudo chown root:root /etc/cron.weekly/cloudflared-updater
```
